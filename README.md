# Compiler_project
This repository contains the C compiler designed in java, as part of the Compiler Construction course at Isfahan University.

## Phases
This project consist of 3 phases:
* Lexical analyzer
* Syntax analyser
* Semantic analyser

## Lexical analyser
Categorizes the contents of the input file as tokens. It is also the job of lexical analyzer to get rid of code comments. The output of the lexical analyzer for our program would look like this:


For this part we used a DFA and it's table to tokenize the code. 
### Implementation of lexical analyser
