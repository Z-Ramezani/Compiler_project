# Compiler_project
This repository contains the C compiler designed in java, as part of the course Compiler Construction at Isfahan University.
This project consist of 3 phase:
* Lexical analyzer
* Synrax analyser
* Semantic analyser

## Lexical analyser
The very first step is to divide the input program code into a group of semantically meaningful units called tokens. It is also the job of lexical analyzer to get rid of code comments. The output of the lexical analyzer for our program would look like this:


For this part we used a DFA and it's table to tokenize the code.
